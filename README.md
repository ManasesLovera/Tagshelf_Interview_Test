### Convert RGB to HSV and HSV to RGB using typescript

For running this code you must have node install, I'm using v20.10.0 <br>
I used typescript for this problem, if you want to executed with an example, first do `npm install`, and then `npm run rgb_hsv`. <br>
I also used python then because the problem said I should've not use any conditionals, didn't find a way to do it without them using typescript. To compile the python program you must use `py <filename>` or just click on the button in vscode, must have python 3 installed.

### Return value with coordenates using C++

For running this code I followed the [visual studio docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw) steps to configure the editor to use the GCC C++ compiler (g++) from mingw-w64. <br>>
First I wanted to use one programming language, but then decided to use different as a personal challenge, to run this code you can either click on F5, click on run using the vscode interface
