### 1. Convert RGB to HSV and HSV to RGB using typescript

For running this code you must have node install, I'm using v20.10.0 <br>
I used typescript for this problem, if you want to executed with an example, first do `npm install`, and then `npm run rgb_hsv`. <br>
I also used python then because the problem said I should've not use any conditionals, didn't find a way to do it without them using typescript. To compile the python program you must use `py <filename>` or just click on the button in vscode, must have python 3 installed. <br>
Edit: I found I way to do it in typescript :v and now it works according to the requirements.

### 2. Return value with coordenates using C++

For running this code I followed the [visual studio docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw) steps to configure the editor to use the GCC C++ compiler (g++) from mingw-w64. <br>>
First I wanted to use one programming language, but then decided to use different as a personal challenge, to run this code you can either click on F5, click on run using the vscode interface

### 3. Count Word

`IN PROGRESS`

### 4. Identify language using C#

I decided building an API using ASP .NET Core, since it was just an endpoint I did a minimal api, to run this code you must have .net 8 installed and in the right directory just type `dotnet run` and that's all, it will open a zwagger app.
